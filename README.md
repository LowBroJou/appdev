1. Bean (1997)
  - Atkinson’s Mr. Bean gain prominence in the television show which bore his name and ran from 1990 to 1995. The character made his silver screen debut two years following the show’s end with Bean. The character is mute, lazy and clumsy. His comedic style is reminiscent of the silent-era clowns—Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin. Mr. Bean is transferred from his position as caretaker of a prestigious British art gallery to a more modest museum in Los Angeles. It doesn’t take long before he causes chaos in his new position.
2. Mr. Bean’s Holiday (2007)
- The follow-up film to Bean, Mr. Bean’s Holiday takes its name from the 1953 comedy Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday, directed by and starring Jacques Tati, another one of Atkinson’s inspirations in the creation of Mr. Bean. In the funny film, the titular character wins a trip to Cannes, France. Hilarious antics ensue as he struggles to reunite a father and a son and encounters a snooty film director (Willem Dafoe).
3. Johnny English (2003)
- After Mr. Bean, Atkinson is perhaps best known for his performances as Johnny English. English is a parody of James Bond, a dim-witted spy with an unfounded level of confidence. He works for the fictional MI7. When every other member of the agency is killed, only Johnny English can prevent the Crown Jewels from being stolen. Starring the likes of John Malkovich and singer/songwriter Natalie Imbruglia, it is an enjoyably goofy film.
4. Johnny English Reborn (2011)
- Eight years after Johnny English, Atkinson et al. returned with Johnny English Reborn. The bumbling, well-meaning MI7 agent must come out of hiding and once again prove his worth after he makes a grave misstep. Along with Atkinson in the eponymous role, the funny film also features a star-studded cast of Rosamund Pike, Gillian Anderson and a rising Daniel Kaluuya prior to his performances in Sicario, Get Out and Black Panther.
